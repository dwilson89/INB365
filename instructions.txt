In order to compile the program, the following command was used in the command line;

gcc -o <ProgramName> AirportSimulator.c -pthread

where <ProgramName> is whatever you want the executable to be called (We use AirportSimulator).


To run the program, simply run the command ./<ProgramName> x y		

Where <ProgramName> is whatever you called the executable above,
x is the desired odds of a plane arriving (percentage between 1-90%)
y is the desired odds of a plane departing (percentage between 1-90%)
